# che525instrumentation
2024 CHE525 Equipment Install

In CHE525 instrumentation was built and commissioned. A Coriolis flow meter, level transmitter, resistance temperature detector (RTD), and pressure transmitter were installed. The Coriolis flow meter is used to measure mass and volume flow plus density, the level transmitter measures the level in a tank, the RTD measures temperature, and the pressure transmitted measures the pressure in the system.

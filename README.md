2024 CHE525 Equipment Install

In CHE525 a Coriolis flow meter, level transmitter, resistance temperature detector (RTD), and pressure transmitter were installed. 
* The Coriolis flow meter is used to measure mass and volume flow plus density.
* The level transmitter measures the level in a tank.
* The RTD measures temperature.
* The pressure transmitter measures the pressure in the system.
